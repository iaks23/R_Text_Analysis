### What is your biggest regret? 

The idea for this project sprung from a popular [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8i6rUL4UIY) by Glamour. People between the ages of 5 and 75 were asked a question about their biggest regret. 

![Screenshot]()

In order to convert the video into a workable dataset, I transcribed the responses provided by the individuals into an Excel sheet, which was then exported as a CSV file. 

The resulting CSV file contained 3 columns, age, gender, and the response and 75 rows. 

|Age|Regret|Gender|
|---|---|---|
|5|"I went to the play ground and I want to go again today"|F|
